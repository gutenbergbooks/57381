<p class="drop-cap">ONCE again the shadow has fallen darkly on all associated
with the Union-Castle Line, both in the City of London and
at sea. Another young member of the Company&#8217;s staff at
the Fenchurch Street offices, Mr. Bernard Castle Stubbs, who joined
the Queen Victoria&#8217;s Rifles (9th Battalion London Regiment) in
September last, has laid down his life for his country. Shortly
after enlistment, he volunteered for the first draft which went out to
make good the casualties in his regiment, and on arriving in France
last February was sent direct to the firing line. He was in the
famous fight on Hill 60 during the night of April 20-21, under the
command of Lieutenant G. H. Woolley, who gained the first Victoria
Cross conferred on a Territorial officer for his gallant efforts in that
bitterly contested struggle. On June 22 Private Stubbs sustained
a shell wound in the head, and he died on the following day at the
Receiving Hospital at Bailleul, without having regained consciousness.
The lad was educated for eight years at Slough, where he
was distinguished both in his classes and in the school sports, and
was head boy of the school during his last few terms, as well as captain
of the cricket and football teams, the holder of a cup for the
school championship at &#8220;fives,&#8221; and the winner of the swimming
medal of the school. He later captained the Old Boys&#8217; football team.
On leaving school in 1907 he entered the offices of the Union-Castle
line, and his death at the early age of 24 has closed what was a very
promising career.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Wednesday</span>, <i>February 10, 1915</i></p>

<p class="drop-cap">OWING to wire calling me back from leave, left
Watford by 7:51 train, catching the 9:10 from
Victoria to Crowboro&#8217;. Left Crowboro&#8217; by
6:03 for Southampton after a fine send-off from rest of
Battalion. Arrived Southampton at 11 <small>P. M.</small> and spent
a good night on floor of board school in the town.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Thursday</span>, <i>February 11, 1915</i></p>

<p>Morning spent in having hair cut short and a nice hot
bath&mdash;just to make sure that anyway I leave England
clean. Afternoon we marched to Army Stores and drew
new rifles and bayonets. In the evening sported 3d at
a local cinema. Another good night on school floor.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Friday</span>, <i>February 12, 1915</i></p>

<p>Stood by till 12 noon all ready to embark, and then
told owing to submarines in Channel we could not get
away. Hung about Southampton all afternoon and
did a music hall in evening. Shall be glad to get a
move on, although Southampton people are very kind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Saturday</span>, <i>February 13, 1915</i></p>

<p>Fred Karno&#8217;s army again! Stood by all morning,
then told no chance of going to-day and dismissed till
roll call at 9:30. Had a game of billiards after drawing
ten bob from local Donald Currie Office, and
just going to have tea when told to return to schools
at once as we were just off. Hurried back and
stood by for an hour, and then dismissed again. Did
another picture show in evening, but spent a rotten
night owing to toothache and squash through more
troops coming in.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Sunday</span>, <i>February 14, 1915</i></p>

<p>Off at last! Told definitely we embark at 12 noon
and actually did so, but did not leave quay until 6.
The whole way down Southampton water we were
covered with searchlights, and then picked up an
escort of destroyers who saw us safely across. But
what a voyage! About 8:30 I found myself wedged
with others into stable with horses a few yards away.
Ship, a cargo boat and rolled like hell! Any amount of
men ill but thank goodness I kept fit. Eventually
dozed off about 11:30.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Monday</span>, <i>February, 15, 1915</i></p>

<p>Made my way out of stable to find ship lying off
Havre at about 6:30 <small>A. M.</small> Eventually docked at 12
noon and then transferred to another and smaller ship<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
for our journey up the Seine. Very surprised at the
size of docks at Havre. The town looked very pretty
from the ship and should have liked a short time
ashore, but nothing doing! Turned in at 8 o&#8217;clock,
but horses made such a row could not sleep. Walked
round ship whilst we left harbour and anchored in
mouth of river, ready for our trip to Rouen in morning.
Finally fell asleep on a form in men&#8217;s quarters
and slept fairly well.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Tuesday</span>, <i>February 16, 1915</i></p>

<p>Up at 6:30 and luckily got a cup of coffee from ship&#8217;s
cook. Have lived on bully beef and biscuits since
leaving Southampton, so coffee was properly appreciated.
Started our voyage up the Seine at 9 o&#8217;clock.
When we left Southampton, we had over 1000 troops
on board; all left at Havre except our 100 and 50
Artists Rifles, so we are a merry little crowd. The
trip up the river was simply great. Glorious day and
the scenery ripping the whole way. Arrived at Rouen
about 5:30 but stayed on board the night. Slept on
the mess-room table and had a good night.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Wednesday</span>, <i>February 17, 1915</i></p>

<p>Left the boat at 8 o&#8217;clock and had a 5-mile march
to reach camp. Poured the whole way, so our first
footing on French soil was hardly encouraging. Arrived
at camp and put eleven in each hut (or tent),
and then, thank God, breakfast turned up. Tea,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
bread and jam&mdash;and didn&#8217;t it go down well! Another
medical inspection and kit finally examined; rest of
day to ourselves. Did a cinema in evening and had a
good night in tent.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Thursday</span>, <i>February 18, 1915</i></p>

<p>Up at 7 o&#8217;clock, and, after an inspection by some
General &#8220;cove&#8221; or other, had day to ourselves. Did
cinema again in evening. Hear we are off to trenches
to-morrow. Now it&#8217;s so near, I&#8217;m very keen on getting
there and hope it comes off.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Friday</span>, <i>February 19, 1915</i></p>

<p>No luck! Stood by all day and no orders came out.
Should like some work to do, as hanging about in tent
tends to make me liverish, humpy and irritable.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Saturday</span>, <i>February 20, 1915</i></p>

<p>Work in earnest. On road making and mud shifting
from 7:15 to 4 o&#8217;clock. Got a grand wash in the
evening and felt happy and fit once more.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Sunday</span>, <i>February 21, 1915</i></p>

<p>Rifle inspection only. Rest of day to ourselves.
No further orders and once again we show our capabilities
at standing by. Awful job to get water to
wash with, and the feeling of filthiness is positively
appalling.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Monday</span>, <i>February 22, 1915</i></p>

<p>Nothing all day beyond rifle inspection in morning.
Told off for not shaving. <i>Inter alia</i>, the trials of a
voluntary soldier, consist of making fires without
wood and shaving without water.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Tuesday</span>, <i>February 23, 1915</i></p>

<p>Off to the trenches at last. Paraded at 2 o&#8217;clock
and marched to Rouen Station. Tremendous train
with all sorts and conditions of troops. Rotten carriages,
a bit worse than the third class on G. E. suburban
trains. Left Rouen 5:50 <small>P. M.</small> and arrived Bailleul
11:30 <small>A. M.</small> February 24, 1915. Detrained to the
sound of artillery.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Wednesday</span>, <i>February 24, 1915</i></p>

<p>Joined up with the First Battalion and met many
old chums from Crowboro&#8217;, just back from trenches
on a few days&#8217; rest. Attached to &#8220;B&#8221; Coy, and
billeted in a barn over a cow shed and pig sty. Had
a grand night&#8217;s rest; woken up once or twice by the
guns which seemed horribly close. Now in Belgium
and disgusted at the state of the peasants and hovels
in which they live. No idea of cleanliness and seem
to revel in dirt. Was present at a search for live
stock by party back from trench; several captures
witnessed, and have now some idea of what is to
come.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Thursday</span>, <i>February 25, 1915</i></p>

<p>Rifle inspection followed by a hot bath in a brewery
tub and a change of linen. What luck! and what a
lovely clean feeling. In the evening letters from home
turned up; four from Jim, one from Mother, and p.c.
from Tick. All are well and I&#8217;m much relieved at
hearing after three weeks.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Friday</span>, <i>February 26, 1915</i></p>

<p>Nothing on to-day so spent afternoon and evening
in Bailleul. Guns rather noisy to-day but otherwise
things fairly quiet.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Saturday</span>, <i>February 27, 1915</i></p>

<p>Ordered to parade to march to trenches at 4:30.
Understand we are going in for eight days, four each
in firing and support trenches. Arrived in firing
trench at 9:30. Cold, wet night, and continually
sniped at during last mile. Relieved Cheshires in
trenches opposite Messines Ridge, and just to encourage
us, Williams and I, who were together in
a lookout, were told by a sergeant we were in one
of the most dangerous parts of the line, as they had
had eight casualties there during the day. Surprised
at the calm way in which we both took this;
and we spent the night on watch, hour in and hour
out, without being worried beyond a few sniper
shots.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Sunday</span>, <i>February 28, 1915</i></p>

<p>A very interesting day. In the morning had a
glorious view of an English airman shelled by anti-aircraft
gun. In the afternoon had my first taste of
shell fire, but the Germans are not good at it and did
very little damage.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Monday</span>, <i>March 1, 1915</i></p>

<p>Sunday night was a perfect beast. Cold and wet
and snipers very busy. As for to-day, my first real
feeling of funk. A shell burst on parapet just in front
of me and gave me a bad shaking. Upset me for about
a quarter of an hour, but kept it to myself and pulled
myself together again. In the evening, while fetching
water, a man shot down three yards from us. Also
rather upsetting but kept my head this time. Reached
support trenches about 10 o&#8217;clock, and had a ripping
sleep safe from snipers and fairly so from shells.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Tuesday</span>, <i>March 2, 1915</i></p>

<p>Nice calm day to-day in redoubt behind firing
line. Nothing to do all day but sleep and did that very
well indeed. Worked all night in cutting down hedge
so as not to affect fire in case of attack&mdash;rotten job,
and sniped at all the time.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Wednesday</span>, <i>March 3, 1915</i></p>

<p>Another calm day. In the afternoon watched
German shells smashing into a village about one half<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
mile from redoubt. Very interesting and a sight never
to be forgotten. Thank Heaven, the people had gone.
Returned to firing line at night.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Thursday</span>, <i>March 4, 1915</i></p>

<p>On Sunday the 28th I wrote the Germans are not
much good with their shells. I now beg their pardon.
The beasts shelled us with heavy guns from 7
in the morning until dusk, and I sincerely hope I
never have a similar experience. It&#8217;s a horrible nerve
racking job and I felt it pretty badly, but everyone
was the same, so there is no need to blame myself.
No sleep all day and all night; I did lookout hour
in and hour out.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Friday</span>, <i>March 5, 1915</i></p>

<p>A fairly calm day after yesterday, but in early
morning surprise fusillade from Germans. Machine
guns and heavy rifle fire. Gave them plenty back and
they soon stopped. Returned to redoubt at night
absolutely done to the world.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Saturday</span>, <i>March 6, 1915</i></p>

<p>My twenty-fourth birthday. Woke at 2 <small>P. M.</small> and
felt much better for long sleep. Wrote Jim and Mother,
and spent afternoon chatting and generally lazing.
On guard from 7 to 9 in evening and 1 to 3 early Sunday
morning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Sunday</span>, <i>March 7, 1915</i></p>

<p>A quiet day in dugout. Found it hard to sleep
owing to heavy artillery fire. Should really return to
billets to-night but ordered to remain as supports.
At 7 <small>P. M.</small> I and fifteen others ordered to proceed to
firing lines. There for three hours during which time I
was on listening patrol&mdash;a particularly nervy and
rotten job. Arrived back in dugouts about midnight.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Monday</span>, <i>March 8, 1915</i></p>

<p>Very quiet day in dugout and had a good sleep.
Worked all night on fatigue, and returned to supporting
line at dawn.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Tuesday</span>, <i>March 9, 1915</i></p>

<p>Stood by all day, and at night received joyful news
to return to billets. Reached them at midnight, and
relief at being out of all danger for the present cannot
be overestimated.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Wednesday</span>, <i>March 10, 1915</i></p>

<p>Slept on well into the day. In evening walked into
village of Dresouke and had a good wash, shave, and
meal. Ye Gods!</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Thursday</span>, <i>March 11, 1915</i></p>

<p>Busy all day on various fatigues. We come from
trenches for what is called a &#8220;rest.&#8221; I should like to
know what the Army Authorities call &#8220;work.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Friday</span>, <i>March 12, 1915</i></p>

<p>Marched into Bailleul and took up fresh billets in
another barn. Very glad to see some really respectable
people, and the barn for a change happened to
be nice and clean.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Saturday</span>, <i>March 13, 1915</i></p>

<p>Morning spent in physical and bayonet drill, and
in the afternoon had a bath and change of linen.
Very nice indeed, and after a good meal spent evening
in recreation-room.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Sunday</span>, <i>March 14, 1915</i></p>

<p>Ye Gods! what a day; turned out at 5 <small>A. M.</small> and left
billets in full marching order for unknown destination
at 9. Marched all morning over an awful cobbled
road and bivouacked in wheatfield all afternoon.
In evening marched to trenches about four miles to
the north of Armentieres. Got right to firing line to
find we were not expected and not wanted. Here we
are twelve or thirteen miles from billets and done to
the wide. Spent two hours lying on the road whilst
an empty farm was found which we reached about
midnight. Went straight off to sleep, and never
remember feeling as whacked before.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Monday</span>, <i>March 15, 1915</i></p>

<p>Spent day in farm waiting for further orders, and
at 8 <small>P. M.</small> once more marched to trenches. Placed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
supports in what once was a village&mdash;now not a whole
house standing. I and six others put into a small
coal cellar of a house of which one wall is now standing.
Spent night on guard. Plenty of snipers about and
grenades fairly frequent, but no shells.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Tuesday</span>, <i>March 16, 1915</i></p>

<p>Quiet day in cellar. Only two shells over, but no harm
done. Evening on guard again similar to last night.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Wednesday</span>, <i>March 17, 1915</i></p>

<p>Another day in cellar. Slept most of the time and
only a few shells over. In evening relieved by Dublin
Fusiliers, and started on our return march to Bailleul
about 9 o&#8217;clock. Reached our billets at 1:30 <small>A. M.</small> Thursday
morning, very, very fagged. That beastly cobbled
road is too awful, and everyone felt whacked,
although the total distance marched could not have
been more than twelve miles.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Thursday</span>, <i>March 18, 1915</i></p>

<p>Up about 10 o&#8217;clock and spent morning cleaning up
once more. In evening had a good meal in town and
retired early, fairly happy once more.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Friday</span>, <i>March 19, 1915</i></p>

<p>Rifle and equipment inspection in morning; afternoon
and evening to ourselves. Toothache very bad
all day and glad to stay in billets.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Saturday</span>, <i>March 20, 1915</i></p>

<p>Route march in morning and spent afternoon sharpening
Company&#8217;s bayonets. In the evening visited
cinema open for first time in Bailleul to-night. Very
good show and thoroughly enjoyed it.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Sunday</span>, <i>March 21, 1915</i></p>

<p>On guard all day outside billets. Very uninteresting
and monotonous except for mild excitement caused
by a German Taube appearing over town. Too high
up for effectual rifle fire and it soon cleared off.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Monday</span>, <i>March 22, 1915</i></p>

<p>A most interesting march to that poor ill-fated
town of Ypres, twelve miles&mdash;the whole way lying a
little behind the firing line. Flying machines galore&mdash;two
heavily but ineffectually shelled by the Germans.
Ypres in shocking condition. Quartered in Belgian
barracks, roof of which has been smashed in in many
places. Don&#8217;t feel particularly safe as town is still
shelled daily, but here&#8217;s hoping our luck will stand.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Tuesday</span>, <i>March 23, 1915</i></p>

<p>Had a stroll round Ypres and returned horribly
depressed. Most beautiful buildings absolutely ruined,
and town is one mass of ruins. A few people still living
there, mainly proprietors of cafés, etc., otherwise
streets deserted. Two shells fell into town to-day
but happily missed the barracks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Wednesday</span>, <i>March 24, 1915</i></p>

<p>Told to be ready for forty-eight hours in trenches to-night.
Spent day making necessary preparations, and
at 8 o&#8217;clock started for what perhaps is most important
point of British lines. Our Company attached to Kings
Own Scottish Borderers&mdash;a fine regiment and awfully
decent chaps. Reached supports about 10. Terrific
rifle fire but we got through with only nine casualties.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Thursday</span>, <i>March 25, 1915</i></p>

<p>Hard at work before dawn improving dugouts,
and, as snipers left off at daybreak and we were in
dead ground, were allowed to stroll about during day.
Heavily shelled for about an hour from 10 to 11,
during which time we laid low. At work during night
improving roads, turning in at 4:30 <small>A. M.</small></p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Friday</span>, <i>March 26, 1915</i></p>

<p>Went to sleep in dugout about 7:30 after a good
drink of hot bovril. Slept well till noon when woke
up to heavy shell fire. Laid low till dusk when shelling
ceased, and we left for our return to billets at 8:15
<small>P. M.</small> Arrived at camp at 10:30 <small>P. M.</small> and once more
thankful at coming through all right.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Saturday</span>, <i>March 27, 1915</i></p>

<p>Up late, and having no parades took things easily.
Afternoon had a game of footer and thoroughly enjoyed
the exercise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Sunday</span>, <i>March 28, 1915</i></p>

<p>Police duty from 7 to 8, 10 to 12, and 4 to 5. Very
quiet and no arrests made.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Monday</span>, <i>March 29, 1915</i></p>

<p>Paraded in morning for drill and bayonet exercise.
In the afternoon walked to Popperinghe and had a very
good time. Fine place untouched by shells, and found
a shop where they sold English tea&mdash;what a luxury!</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Tuesday</span>, <i>March 30, 1915</i></p>

<p>Joy of joys! Ordered to parade for a bath. First
one since the March 13th, and it was very welcome.
Am now decidedly &#8220;Itchy Koo&#8221; and am so ashamed
of it, but am afraid it cannot be avoided.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Wednesday</span>, <i>March 31, 1915</i></p>

<p>Marched from camp back into the barracks at
Ypres, and understand we are now once more standing
by and will go into trenches on Friday evening.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Thursday</span>, <i>April 1, 1915</i></p>

<p>Bayonet drill, etc., in morning. Town shelled during
day. One in barracks but not much damage.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Friday</span>, <i>April 2, 1915</i></p>

<p>Not going to trenches to-night owing to dangerous
roads when carrying on relief. Instead we are to do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
five days straight off from Monday next. Quiet day,
nothing doing beyond fatigue work, attended Morning
Service for first time since leaving England.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Saturday</span>, <i>April 3, 1915</i></p>

<p>Town again shelled during day. More civilians
killed but barracks again escape. Drill and fatigues
only. In afternoon attended service conducted by
Bishop of London. Short but very nice service.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Sunday</span>, <i>April 4, 1915</i></p>

<p>Church in morning. Quiet all day till 9, when I
went up to trenches on digging fatigue. Got to bed
about 2:30 and jolly glad to lie in on Monday morning.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Monday</span>, <i>April 5, 1915</i></p>

<p>Up late, and spent day getting ready for our trip
to trenches. Left barracks at 6:45 and carried out
relief at 9 <small>P. M.</small> Very busy night. Continual deliberate
fire and, oh, how it rained! No cover whatever and
we&#8217;ve got this for five days. Ye Gods!</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Tuesday</span>, <i>April 6, 1915</i></p>

<p>Rained on and off whole day. Impossible to sleep
owing to rain and shells. Feel very despondent and
miserable, but long time to go yet so must stick
it. Another busy night and more rain. Am now
properly soaked, so it does not matter if it pours all
the time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Wednesday</span>, <i>April 7, 1915</i></p>

<p>Weather slightly better, but still plenty of rain on
and off. Artillery active, otherwise day fairly quiet.
Periscope very useful indeed. Night very busy indeed,
continued rifle and artillery fire. Several narrow
escapes whilst searching German lines. Twice covered
with sand from shots in bags to my right and left.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Thursday</span>, <i>April 8, 1915</i></p>

<p>Thank goodness! decided improvement in weather.
One or two hail showers but not much rain. Wind
very cold, and, by jove! it&#8217;s hard to sleep. Quiet day
but another busy night. Spoiled so far as I am concerned
by violent toothache; must see a dentist after
this spell, without fail.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Friday</span>, <i>April 9, 1915</i></p>

<p>No sleep all day owing to toothache. Hard luck
as day comparatively quiet&mdash;very little shell fire from
either side. Night again very busy but glad of the
work as helps me to forget the pain.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Saturday</span>, <i>April 10, 1915</i></p>

<p>Relief coming to-night and arn&#8217;t I glad. Slept
a couple of hours in morning and again in afternoon.
Artillery busy once more. Bedfords turned
up, 11:30, so we got away about 12; reached camp
1:30. Had a cup of tea and asleep at once. Another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
spell got through and so far not touched. Thank
Heaven for my luck!</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Sunday</span>, <i>April 11, 1915</i></p>

<p>Woke at 2 <small>P. M.</small> Had a wash and shave and feel
fine once more. Spent evening writing letters and going
to make most of rest.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Monday</span>, <i>April 12, 1915</i></p>

<p>Paraded sick and doctor gives me pills for toothache.
What a fool! Shall keep at him till he sends me to
a dentist. Visited by a Zeppelin during night. Dropped
six bombs, nearest two hundred yards from camp.
Enormous holes but no damage. Our luck in again!</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Tuesday</span>, <i>April 13, 1915</i></p>

<p>Received more pills from doctor. Nearly called him
a fool. Had a lazy afternoon, and no sign of Zeppelins.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Wednesday</span>, <i>April 14, 1915</i></p>

<p>More pills in morning. Afternoon footer match
between Ninth and Twelfth battalions. We lost 2-0.
Played very well together; jolly good side&mdash;the Twelfth&mdash;and
it was a good game.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Thursday</span>, <i>April 15, 1915</i></p>

<p>More pills. Have now sufficient for a shop, but
shall stick at him till I get it out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Friday</span>, <i>April 16, 1915</i></p>

<p>Hurrah! Told to go to hospital at Popperinghe
and see the dentist. Jolly nice chap and tooth soon
out. Pretty painful job, but expected that, and am so
glad to get it out. Spent afternoon in town, and
back at camp at 7:30. Quite a successful day.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Saturday</span>, <i>April 17, 1915</i></p>

<p>Drill in morning and afternoon, standing by ready
to leave camp at one hour&#8217;s notice, owing to attack to be
made on trenches and hill outside Ypres. Tremendous
bombardment commenced by our artillery at 7 <small>P. M.</small>
Kept up all night, and must have given the Huns hell!</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Sunday</span>, <i>April 18, 1915</i></p>

<p>Turned out at 7 and told we leave for reserve line
at 8 to support our Brigade, in view of expected
counter-attack&mdash;our attack on their trenches having
been successful.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Monday</span>, <i>April 19, 1915</i></p>

<p>Germans started our game of artillery bombardment,
and gave it us hot all day. Understand they
counter-attacked twice but were repulsed. Not
moved out of reserve line.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Tuesday</span>, <i>April 20, 1915</i></p>

<p>Our chaps getting it hot all day, and at 6 <small>P. M.</small> we
were moved up to firing line under perfect torrent of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
shells, shrapnel, and machine guns&mdash;most awful hour
ever experienced and nerves absolutely gone. Two of
our companies have had very hot time, losing many
men. Luckily we did not have quite so many casualties.
At dawn moved back into supports, our
position being taken over by regulars. I pray I may
never have a similar experience. Too ghastly even
to write about.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Wednesday</span>, <i>April 21, 1915</i></p>

<p>Laid in supports all day. Situation apparently
died down a bit, but we are staying here through night.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Thursday</span>, <i>April 22, 1915</i></p>

<p>Relieved and returned to billets. Had not been
there ten minutes before to our horror we saw French
retreating on our left in a panic. Battalion rallied and
dug trench prepared to do our best. At 12 midnight
informed that Canadians had saved situation, but
French trenches still in hands of enemy. Our Brigade
told off to retake them.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Friday</span>, <i>April, 23, 1915</i></p>

<p>Moved to new position north of Ypres, and trenches
retaken by Kings Own Scottish Borderers and West
Kents, we acting as supports. Stayed all night making
fatigue journeys to firing line, and oh! how I should
like some sleep.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Saturday</span>, <i>April 24, 1915</i></p>

<p>Hurried off to another part of line where Germans
had also broken through. Journey made under
terrific shell fire and half Battalion is now gone.
Position taken up in reserve trenches to be held at all
costs. Very exciting but keeping calm and cool.
Never prayed so fervently before, but am quite prepared
to face whatever is to come and, please God,
we shall stop them. Shell fire is awful.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Sunday</span>, <i>April 25, 1915</i></p>

<p>Reinforcements up at dawn and attack in open order
started. At first successful, and then to our horror saw
our chaps retreating in disorder and Germans behind
them a mile to our front. Most awful fifteen minutes
of my life&mdash;shells everywhere&mdash;men being blown to
pieces, and we unable to help, but bound to wait for
Germans and drive them off. Then our chaps rallied
and to our joy turned the tables, driving them back
into woods and holding them there despite shells and foul
gas bombs. Stayed there all day, shelled whole time.
Evening position unchanged and we must stop here.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Monday</span>, <i>April 26, 1915</i></p>

<p>At dawn hear more reinforcements are up and we
can go. Thank God, it&#8217;s over and the position safe.
Trench strength of Battalion is now 230 rifles which
will show what we have been through (normal strength
about 1000).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span></p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Tuesday</span>, <i>April 27, 1915</i></p>

<p>Spent all day just behind firing line in reserve, and
shall probably be here for some days. But what a
difference a night&#8217;s rest does make, and I&#8217;m ready to
go forward at any time.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Wednesday</span>, <i>April 28, 1915</i></p>

<p>Another day spent in reserve. Did nothing much
all day and glad of the quiet. Shells falling pretty
close to billet, but none near enough to hurt.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Thursday</span>, <i>April 29, 1915</i></p>

<p>Ordered to return to trenches and left at 7 <small>P. M.</small>
Arrived firing line at 10 <small>P. M.</small> and spent night on watch.
Nothing much doing; just a little sniping, and they
got a pal of mine through the neck a few yards from
me. Blackguards!</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Friday</span>, <i>April 30, 1915</i></p>

<p>Shelled from early morning to late at night. Another
rotten experience, and am rapidly developing
that awful complaint of &#8220;shellitis.&#8221; If no attack
at dusk we are to be relieved, so here&#8217;s hoping they
keep away from us.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Saturday</span>, <i>May 1, 1915</i></p>

<p>We were relieved during night and marched some
way from trenches into a wood, where we are to stay
for a day or two. Rigged up a covering of twigs, etc.,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
and slept during day. Sing-song in evening and feeling
a bit more cheerful.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Sunday</span>, <i>May 2, 1915</i></p>

<p>Quiet day but called out at night owing to German
attack. Laid in reserve trenches all night and returned
to woods at dawn.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Monday</span>, <i>May 3, 1915</i></p>

<p>Slept during day and once more called out at night
owing to another German attack. Reserve trenches
again all night, but once more attack repulsed and
returned to woods.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Tuesday</span>, <i>May 4, 1915</i></p>

<p>Actually off for rest at last, and marched five miles
from Ypres to a village where we spent night. Understand
we continue our journey in morning.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Wednesday</span>, <i>May 5, 1915</i></p>

<p>What jolly hard luck we are having. Hill Sixty lost
last night and we are to return to Ypres to help in counter-attack.
Marched all day back in boiling sun and
spent night just behind firing line. Understand we go
in to-morrow. Rather dread it, but it&#8217;s got to be done.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Thursday</span>, <i>May 6, 1915</i></p>

<p>Spent day in dugout whilst troops gathered
together for to-night&#8217;s attack. Eight from our Company<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
picked out to do nothing else but carry up
ammunition as our men advance. Moved up to
Hill Sixty at dusk, and at 2:30 <small>A. M.</small> attack commenced.
Carried up ammunition with another chap right up
to advance trenches. Terribly hot fire from machine
guns and whiz-bangs, and rather a terrible experience.
Stuck it till my partner overcome by gas. Helped him
to dressing station, and then gave a hand helping down
wounded. Poor devils, but what pluck most of them
have got. Turned in at 5 <small>A. M.</small> after hearing attack
partially successful.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Friday</span>, <i>May 7, 1915</i></p>

<p>Day in reserve ready for any counter-attack but none
came off. Night on fatigue work: carrying sand bags,
etc., to firing line. Off duty at 3 <small>A. M.</small>, and moved back
nearer Ypres, but are still in reserve. Adjutant killed
this morning: fine soldier and great loss to the Battalion.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Saturday</span>, <i>May 8, 1915</i></p>

<p>Another day in reserve and night on fatigue, but
was lucky in not having to go to trenches. Fetched
rations and filled water bottles only.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Sunday</span>, <i>May 9, 1915</i></p>

<p>Firing line again, this time digging communication
trench and repairing parapets where knocked
down by shells. Wonderful view of Ypres on fire in
three places and rapidly spreading.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Monday</span>, <i>May 10, 1915</i></p>

<p>Carried up rations to West Lancshires. Awful
job&mdash;sacks very heavy. Man in front of me shot in
chest coming away. Carried him into cover and
fetched stretcher bearers.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Tuesday</span>, <i>May 11, 1915</i></p>

<p>Sand bags to firing line after spending quiet day.
Our dugouts shelled during day and three men hit.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Wednesday</span>, <i>May 12, 1915</i></p>

<p>Good news! We are to be relieved to-night. Left
dugouts at 10:30 and reached camp at 5 <small>A. M.</small> weary
and happy.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Thursday</span>, <i>May 13, 1915</i>, to <span class="smcap">Thursday</span>, <i>May 20, 1915</i></p>

<p>Most enjoyable week&#8217;s rest in camp at Locre. Did
nothing of any importance and heard no guns and
had no shells over. Felt all the better for it, but has
gone all too quickly.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Friday</span>, <i>May 21, 1915</i></p>

<p>Moved to huts nearer firing line and once more
in sound of guns. Rotten!</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Saturday</span>, <i>May 22, 1915</i></p>

<p>Moved further up into dugouts and are now back
in line once more.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Sunday</span>, <i>May 23, 1915</i></p>

<p>Quiet day, but hard at work all night. Germans attacked
2 <small>A. M.</small> Monday morning and used gas. Horrible
stuff. On our way to dugouts had fifteen in front of me
knocked out by a shell. Awful sight and very upsetting.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Monday</span>, <i>May 24, 1915</i></p>

<p>Quiet day spent in recovering from effects of gas.
Hard at work again all night.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Tuesday</span>, <i>May 25, 1915</i></p>

<p>Remarks of yesterday apply to to-day. Hope this
comparative calm continues whilst we are up.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Wednesday</span>, <i>May 26, 1915</i></p>

<p>Shelled on way to dugouts, early morning, with
shrapnel but luckily no casualties. Evening left
dugouts for fire trenches at St. Eloi. Arrived at midnight
and relieved the Liverpool Scottish. Quiet night.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Thursday</span> and <span class="smcap">Friday</span>, <i>May 27, 1915</i>, and <i>May 28, 1915</i></p>

<p>Two quiet days in trenches. Nothing doing
beyond sniping. Friday evening we left trenches
for reserve line in a wood.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Saturday</span> and <span class="smcap">Sunday</span>, <i>May 29, 1915</i>, and <i>May 30, 1915</i></p>

<p>Two lazy days in wood. On Saturday night carried
rations to trenches, and on Sunday returned to
trenches for another spell.</p>

<p>Four days on detached post connecting Queen

returned to supporting line about two hundred yards
behind fire trenches.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Friday</span> and <span class="smcap">Saturday</span>, <i>June 4, 1915</i>, and <i>June 5, 1915</i></p>

<p>On fatigue duty in supports; both days improving

<p><i>Dear Madam</i>: In answer to your inquiry by telegram,
I regret to inform you that Rifleman Stubbs,
B. C. No. 2655, was wounded by shell fire on Tuesday,
June 22, and has, we are deeply sorry to say, since
passed away, having succumbed to his injuries.</p>

<p>His death is much lamented by his officers and comrades,
two of whom were wounded by the same shell,
one rather seriously.</p>

<p>Deeply sympathizing with you in your terrible loss,
I am,</p>

<p class="center">Yours sincerely,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mrs. Stubbs</span>:</p>

<p>This is to convey to you my sincere sympathy in
the death of your son, Pr. Stubbs, who died from
wounds received last Tuesday. His death was most
unfortunate, a large German shell falling right in our
trench, severely wounding your son and two others;
when I saw your son&#8217;s wound (a severe gash on the
scalp), I was sure that there was very little hope of his
recovery and I was surprised that he survived so long.
Mercifully he was quite unconscious all the time, and
so, I think, suffered no pain.</p>

<p>Although he did not come out with the battalion in
November, he joined, I think, with the first draft and
so has been through all the heavy work we have done.
I am sure you will be glad to know what a good soldier
he was, and that he was always cheerful and did his
work well during the hardships of the winter months.</p>

<p>You may be sure his loss will be felt very deeply
both by myself and by the rest of the platoon. But
take comfort in this, that he died a noble soldier&#8217;s
death in a magnificent cause.</p>

<p>Again assuring you of my deep sympathy, I am,</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
